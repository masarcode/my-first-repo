Hey, I'm Masar!

I enjoy reading, learning new things, dreaming big, and building cool things!                

I am currently a 2nd year college student. 

My major is Computer Science and my minor is statistics/mathematics.

I know a Python and Java and I am currently studying C and R. 

My academic interests are AI/deep/machine learning, quantum computing, nanotech, economics/world affairs, and entrepreneurship. 

After college I would love to obtain an MS in computer science with a specialty in AI.
